Chords:
Verse 1:
My [G] head is stuck in the [D] clouds
[G] She begs me to come [D] down
Says, [Em] "Boy, quit [D] foolin' [C] around"
I told her, "I [G] love the view from up [D] here
[G] Warm sun and wind in my [D] ear
We'll [Em] watch the [D] world from [C] above
As it [D] turns to the rhythm of [G] love"

Chorus:
We may [Em] only [C] have [G] tonight
But till the [Em] morning [C] sun, you're [G] mine
[B7] All [Em] mine
Play the [D] music [C] low
And [D] sway to the rhythm of [G] love

Verse 2:
[G] My heart beats like a [D] drum
[G] A guitar string to the [D] strum
A [Em] beautiful [D] song to be [C] sung
She's got [G] blue eyes deep like the [D] sea
[G] That roll back when she's laughing at [D] me
She [Em] rises [D] up like the [C] tide
The [D] moment her lips meet [G] mine

[Chorus]

Bridge:
[B7] When the [C] moon is [G] low [D]
[B7] We can [C] dance in [G] slow [D] motion [A]
And [C] all your [D] tears will subside [C]
[C] All your [D] tears [G] will dry

[G] Bah bah ba ba [D] bah bah, [G] Bah bah ba ba [D] bah bah,
[Em] Daaah da da [D] Dum da da [C] dum (x2)

Verse 3:
[G] And long after I've [D] gone
[G] You'll still be humming [D] along
And [Em] I will keep [D] you in my [C] mind
The [D] way you make love so [G] fine

[Chorus]

Play the [D] music [C] low
And [D] sway to the rhythm of [G] love
Yeah, [D] sway to the rhythm of [G] love [D] - [G]
